# Welcome to the HCI Methods Superbook

This comprehensive resource collects and categorizes the many ways Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) artifacts are evaluated, with a special emphasis on **wearable devices**. Our content is primarily sourced from the ACM Digital Library and IEEE publications to ensure academic rigor and current best practices.

## What You'll Find Here

### ðŸ“± Wearable Device Evaluation Methods
Specialized techniques for evaluating smartwatches, fitness trackers, AR/VR headsets, and other wearable technologies.

### ðŸ”¬ Traditional HCI Evaluation Methods
Comprehensive coverage of established evaluation techniques including usability testing, heuristic evaluation, and user studies.

### ðŸ“Š Quantitative & Qualitative Approaches
Methods ranging from statistical analysis and performance metrics to ethnographic studies and phenomenological research.

### ðŸŽ¯ Context-Specific Evaluations
Evaluation approaches tailored to specific domains, user groups, and interaction contexts.
