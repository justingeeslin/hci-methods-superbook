# Quantitative HCI Evaluation Methods

Data-driven approaches that provide measurable, statistical insights into user behavior and system performance. These methods emphasize objective measurement and statistical analysis to understand user interactions and system effectiveness.

## Key Characteristics

- **Measurable outcomes** - Quantifiable metrics and performance indicators
- **Statistical analysis** - Hypothesis testing and significance testing
- **Large sample sizes** - Statistical power through adequate participant numbers
- **Controlled variables** - Systematic manipulation of design factors
- **Reproducible results** - Standardized procedures for replication

## Common Quantitative Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Task completion time** - Speed of task performance
- **Error rates** - Frequency and types of user errors
- **Success rates** - Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- **Efficiency measures** - Ratio of successful actions to total actions

### Behavioral Metrics
- **Click-through rates** - User engagement with interface elements
- **Navigation patterns** - Paths through interface structures
- **Feature usage frequency** - Adoption and utilization of system features
- **Session duration** - Time spent using the system

### Physiological Metrics
- **Eye tracking data** - Visual attention and scanning patterns
- **Heart rate variability** - Stress and cognitive load indicators
- **Galvanic skin response** - Emotional arousal measurements
- **EEG signals** - Brain activity during interaction

## Statistical Analysis Approaches

### Descriptive Statistics
- **Central tendency** - Mean, median, mode of performance metrics
- **Variability** - Standard deviation, range, interquartile range
- **Distribution analysis** - Normality testing and data transformation
- **Correlation analysis** - Relationships between variables

### Inferential Statistics
- **T-tests** - Comparing means between groups or conditions
- **ANOVA** - Analysis of variance for multiple groups or factors
- **Regression analysis** - Predicting outcomes from multiple variables
- **Non-parametric tests** - Analysis when assumptions are violated

### Advanced Techniques
- **Multilevel modeling** - Nested data structures (users within groups)
- **Time series analysis** - Longitudinal data and temporal patterns
- **Machine learning** - Pattern recognition and predictive modeling
- **Bayesian analysis** - Incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty

## Applications in HCI

### A/B Testing
Comparing two or more interface variants to determine which performs better on specific metrics.

### Usability Benchmarking
Establishing baseline performance metrics and tracking improvements over time.

### Accessibility Measurement
Quantifying accessibility barriers and measuring improvement interventions.

### Performance Optimization
Identifying bottlenecks and measuring the impact of optimization efforts.

## Best Practices

### Study Design
1. **Clear hypotheses** - Specific, testable predictions about outcomes
2. **Appropriate sample sizes** - Power analysis to determine adequate N
3. **Control conditions** - Proper comparison groups and baselines
4. **Randomization** - Random assignment to reduce bias

### Data Collection
1. **Reliable instruments** - Validated measurement tools and procedures
2. **Consistent protocols** - Standardized data collection procedures
3. **Quality assurance** - Data validation and error checking
4. **Ethical considerations** - Informed consent and data protection

### Analysis and Reporting
1. **Assumption checking** - Verify statistical test requirements
2. **Effect size reporting** - Practical significance beyond statistical significance
3. **Confidence intervals** - Uncertainty quantification around estimates
4. **Replication considerations** - Sufficient detail for study reproduction
