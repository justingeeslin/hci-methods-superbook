# About the HCI Methods Superbook

## Mission

The HCI Methods Superbook is a comprehensive, open-access resource that collects and categorizes the many ways Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) artifacts are evaluated. Our goal is to provide researchers, practitioners, and students with a centralized, well-organized collection of evaluation methods that reflects current best practices in the field.

## Focus Areas

### Wearable Devices
We place special emphasis on evaluation methods for wearable technologies, including:
- Smartwatches and fitness trackers
- Augmented and virtual reality headsets
- Smart clothing and textiles
- Implantable and body-worn sensors
- Haptic and tactile interfaces

### Comprehensive HCI Coverage
Beyond wearables, we cover the full spectrum of HCI evaluation methods:
- Traditional usability evaluation
- User experience research
- Accessibility assessment
- Context-aware computing evaluation
- Social computing research methods

## Sources and Methodology
