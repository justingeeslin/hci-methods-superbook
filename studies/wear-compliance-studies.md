- **Feature utilization** (which device functions are actually used)
- **Data synchronization** (frequency of data uploads/reviews)
- **Goal achievement** (meeting device-set or user-set targets)
- **Social engagement** (participation in sharing/comparison features)

### Contextual Factors
- **Device comfort** (physical wearability and aesthetics)
- **Technical issues** (battery life, connectivity, accuracy)
- **Lifestyle integration** (fit with daily routines and activities)
- **Social support** (peer influence and healthcare provider engagement)
