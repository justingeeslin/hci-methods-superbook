# Research Studies Using HCI Methods

This section catalogs specific research studies that have employed the evaluation methods documented in this collection. Each study page provides concrete examples of how methods are applied in practice, including study designs, participant details, key findings, and full academic citations.

## Available Study Collections

### Wearable Device Research

**[Wear Compliance Studies](/hci-methods-superbook/studies/wear-compliance-studies/)**
- Studies examining long-term adoption and usage patterns of wearable devices
- Includes foundational research, abandonment studies, and clinical applications
- Features studies from CHI, UbiComp, JMIR, and other premier venues

## Study Categories

### By Research Domain
- **Healthcare and Clinical Studies** - Medical applications and patient populations
- **Workplace and Organizational Studies** - Corporate wellness and productivity applications
- **Personal Informatics Research** - Self-tracking and behavior change studies
- **Device Abandonment Research** - Understanding why users stop using wearables

### By Methodology
- **Longitudinal Cohort Studies** - Extended tracking of usage patterns over time
- **Cross-Sectional Surveys** - Snapshot assessments of usage at specific points
- **Mixed-Methods Approaches** - Combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights
- **Clinical Integration Studies** - Evaluating wearables in healthcare contexts

### By Population
- **General Consumer Studies** - Broad population samples
- **Clinical Populations** - Patients with specific health conditions
